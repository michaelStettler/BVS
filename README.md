Brain Visual System modelling toolbox

The toolbox aim to model the different visual pathway of the human brain. The toolbox is built to help putting different submodules as to try different theorotical approchaes and study their implication on different task such as categorization.
The models can be assessed by computing a biological score. The score represent how well the model pass tests that correlate with known behaviour/experimental data of the visual system.
The model can also be assessed in their computational complexity, with the number of parameter used and their performance, this may help to select simpler model for similar biological score.
