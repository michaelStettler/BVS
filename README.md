# BVS
Brain Visual System modelling toolbox

The toolbox aim to model the different visual pathway of the human brain. The toolbox is built to help putting different submodules as to try different theoretical approches and study their implication as a system on different task; i.e. categorization, classification etc. 

The motivation lies since many early work in machine learning and computer vision were focused on building specific features but has been vanished since deep learning methods shows a fantastic increase of performance. Yet systems using deep learning methods have become treated as black box, in such, we lost in expandability of the components while favoring a general performance score. With this tooldbox, we hope to leverage the power and scalability of common deep learning framework such as Tensorflow to implement basic theoretical component of our visual system and allow to merge/combine these components with state of the art architecture and study more in depth their implication. 

While many research focus on studying the similarity of Neuronal Networks compared to behavioural study. Where Di Carlo even proposed a brain score over Deep learning architectures. With this work, we hope to center the discussion back to a theoretical approaches were one could start with an hypothesis and investigate its assumptions as a system. By using common framework, one could study how its hypothesis impacts with the overall performance score, but also keeping in mind the complexity of the model and especially the explainability of each of its components. 

In such, we would like to follow the idea of a "brain score" mechanism but related to each modules. We hope with this work to help researchers to focus on the brain area which are less understood and propose mechanism to build more robust system.

The toolbox will first focus on building models to represent how the brain perceive dynamic facial expressions. The reason lies as many dataset are available to train model on faces, and many psychological and behavioral study will draw the general line to compute the a "BVS" scores.
